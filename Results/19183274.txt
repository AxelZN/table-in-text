The presence of H type 2 oligosaccharide reduced binding of the S. Typhimurium fim rosE mutant ( CD8R ) to Caco - 2 cells to the level of the S. Typhimurium fim rosE Δstd mutant ( CD20 ) ( P = 0.002 ) ( Figure 3A ) .

A S. Typhimurium fim fliC fljB dam +803 : : Mud - Cam mutant ( Chessa et al. , 2008b ) was grown statically in 2 liters of LB broth at 37 °C over night , harvested by centrifugation , and cells resuspended in 10 ml of 0.5 mM Tris 75mM NaCl .
