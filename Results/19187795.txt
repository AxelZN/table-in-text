Antibodies were obtained from each source : goat anti-4-1BBL antibody ( CD137L , Santa Cruz ) ( Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) ; rabbit anti-GFP antibody , donkey anti-goat-CY3 and goat anti-rabbit-FITC antibody ( Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology , HaiMen , Jiangsu , China ) ; CD3 - PE , CD3 - FITC , CD8 - FITC ( ebioscience ) , CD4 - FITC and CD25 - PE ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) .

The sequences of forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers , speciﬁc to the chosen candidates and housekeeping genes were 5 ′ - CAC AAG TTC AGC GTG TCC G - 3 ′ and 5 ′ - CTC GAT GCG GTT CAC CAG - 3 ′ for GFP ; 5 ′ - GAG GGA AAT CGT GCG TGA C - 3 ′ and 5 ′ - TAG AAG CAT TTG CGG TGC - 3 ′ for - actin .
