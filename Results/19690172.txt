Explanation Mutation in glnP , the glutamine - binding protein , results in the inability to grow on proline ( 29 ) Mutation in glnP results in an inability to grow on L - glutamate ( 29 ) Many E. coli K12 strains harbor a thermolabilespecific aldolase involved in galactitol degradation ( 51 ) FNR i.e. anaerobiosis - dependent expression of ansB ( L - asparagine II ) occurs in E. coli but not Salmonella ( 37 ) -- The pdu operon is present in Salmonella but absent in E. coli ( 38 , 52 ) ApeE , an outer membrane esterase present in Salmonella , allows hydrolysis of naphthyl esters ( 53 , 54 ) ApeE , an outer membrane esterase present in Salmonella , allows hydrolysis of naphthyl esters ( 53 , 54 ) Genes for ribitol catabolism missing in E. coli K12 ( 55 , 56 ) The cit / tcu operon is absent in most E. coli but enables citrate utilization in Salmonella ( 57 ) The cit / tcu operon , absent in E. coli , is also responsible for metabolism of the structurally related tricarballylic acid ( 58 ) The hpa operon required for catabolism of 4 - HPA is present in Salmonella but missing in E. coli K12 strains ( 39 ) The hpa operon required for catabolism of 4 - HPA is present in Salmonella but missing in E. coli K12 ( 39 ) -- The deoQKPX operon , absent from E. coli , is required for the uptake , phosphorylation , and regulation of 2 - deoxy - D - ribose utilization ( 59 ) The presence of tag genes in the gat ( galactitol ) operon enables degradation of D - tagatose in Salmonella -- In Salmonella , tyramine utilization as a carbon source results from its oxidative deamination by the cell membrane - bound tyramine oxidase ( TynA / MaoA ) to 4 - HPA , requiring the hpa operon , which is absent from E. coli K12 ( 60 ) The ebg operon required for lactulose utilization is absent in Salmonella ( 61 , 62 ) Tartrate dehydrogenase , yeaU or ttuC , required for the breakdown of D - malate , is present in E. coli ( 22 , 63 ) but absent from Salmonell 0 1 1 1 Carbon Carbon L - Glutamic acid Dulcitol / galactitol EX_glu - L EX_galt glnP kba 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 ansB Carbon L - Asparagine EX_asn -

encoded transporter for ManNac uptake and nan genes for its utilization , resulting in very slow growth in E. coli K12 ( 67 ) The L - tryptophan inducible tryptophanase utilized by E. coli ( 68 ) is missing in Salmonella E. coli contains the codAB genes required for cytosine uptake and deamination regulated by Nac ( 69 ) , which are absent in S. typhimurium Three phosphatases ( YeaI , PhoA , YnbD ) , which may enable E. coli to cleave phosphorous from phosphate esters , are absent in Salmonella ( 70 ) BetT , the high affinity choline transporter present in E. coli ( 71 ) , is absent in S. typhimurium , which also has the three phosphatases missing The two sulfonate systems present in E. coli are absent in Salmonella and may be responsible for utilization of this compound The taurine uptake and utilization operon from E. coli ( 72 , 73 ) is absent in Salmonella Hypotaurine is probably utilized by the same operon in E. coli This operon is present in E. coli under regulation of CysB and Cbl and is required for butane sulfonic acid utilization ( 74 -- 76 ) The ssu operon is also involved in 2 -
